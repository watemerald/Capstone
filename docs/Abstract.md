Search has been an important part of accessing information on the web since the internet has existed. Starting from simple catalogues and relevancy term searches to the ranking methods which display the most relevant information to the search user. The problem for many of those situations has been that it was only suitable for searching and indexing of text data. As more information is getting shared in video form, searching for that becomes harder. The main source of that information has been text information: video title, description, tags. With the rise of computer vision it is now possible to extract information from images, specifically video frames, and use that information for search instead.
In this project, I make use of YouTube-8M, a video classification benchmark, to get appropriate video labels, and use them to construct a video search engine. I will compare how well the search performs using only the user-entered tags, the autogenerated labels, and both together, and propose whether automated tagging system could be used to improve video search in general.
