# CSC 690 Graduate Capstone in Computer Science \n Improving Video Search with automated tagging

This repository is my capstone project, with it being in its initial starting state right now. It contains 2 main folders:

1. [docs](docs), which contains all documentation related to the project, including a list of sources uset at [docs/sources.md](docs/sources.md)
2. [video-search](video-search), which contains all the working code, as well as most of the files required to run the code, with the exception of the dataset I'm using, YouTube-8M, which is stored locally. In the future, this should be expanded with instructions on how to download the dataset and launch this program from scratch.
